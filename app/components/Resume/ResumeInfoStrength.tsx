            The Apple Media Products Engineering team is one of the most
            exciting examples of Apple’s long-held passion for combining art and
            technology. These are the people who power the App Store, Apple TV,
            Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books. And they do it on a
            massive scale, meeting Apple’s high expectations with high
            performance to deliver a huge variety of entertainment in over 35
            languages to more than 150 countries These engineers build secure,
            end-to-end solutions. They develop the custom software used to
            process all the creative work, the tools that providers use to
            deliver that media, all the server-side systems, and the APIs for
            many Apple services. Thanks to Apple’s unique integration of
            hardware, software, and services, engineers here partner to get
            behind a single unified vision. That vision always includes a deep
            commitment to strengthening Apple’s privacy policy, one of Apple’s
            core values. Although services are a bigger part of Apple’s business
            than ever before, these teams remain small, nimble, and
            cross-functional, offering greater exposure to the array of
            opportunities here.
